            <h1>Day in the life...</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Triston Golden for those of you visiting this webpage. As you read along throughout this webpage I will continue to open up about myself and share with you some details that will help you get to know me better.</p>
            <p>I'm the oldest of five children, which needless to say I try my best to lead by example. I graduated from Shiloh High School in Gwinnett county. I did wrestling and football year round. I got my first real job at my local McDonald's.</p>
            <p>During my college days I loved to play Madden and NBA 2K as well as play recreational basketball at my local LA Fitness. At one point I was a top 1,500 Madden NFL plaayer in the world on the playstation 4. I can't forget about NBA 2K though! I very much enjoyed creating my own myplayer build, as well as being yelled at by 3rd graders about how bad I was at the game.</p>

            <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, my first job was at McDonald's. When I moved to college I was able to essentially transfer to a closer McDonald's in the city of Kennesaw.></p>
            <p>During my time at Kennesaw State I was a full time student, and also I worked for a local Homegoods and work study position. I pretty much worked these two jobs throughout my entire tenure at Kennesaw State.</p>
            <p>During my second to last semester of college I was hired at AT&T, where I worked for a little over 3 years.</p>
